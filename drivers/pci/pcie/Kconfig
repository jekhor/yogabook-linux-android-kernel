	  This enables OS control over PCI Express ASPM (Active State
	  Power Management) and Clock Power Management. ASPM supports
	  state L0/L0s/L1.

	  ASPM is initially set up by the firmware. With this option enabled,
	  Linux can modify this state in order to disable ASPM on known-bad
	  hardware or configurations and enable it when known-safe.

	  ASPM can be disabled or enabled at runtime via
	  /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy

	  When in doubt, say Y.

	help
	  This enables the OS control over PCI Express ASPM L1 Sub-states.

          This feature is initially set up by the firmware. Generally, No
	  need OS support on it. For some special PCIe devices, the power
	  supply may be cut off for power saving which may cause the ASPM
          L1 Sub-States settings get lost. By enabling this, the OS can
	  save and restore the related settings.

          when in doubt, say N.

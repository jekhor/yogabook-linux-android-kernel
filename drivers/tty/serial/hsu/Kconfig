# The Intel High Speed UART serial drivers.

config SERIAL_HSU
	tristate "Intel High Speed UART support"
	depends on PCI
	select SERIAL_CORE
	---help---
	  This is the High Speed UART protocol driver for Intel Mid UART Controller
	  and Synopsys Designware APB UART.

	  Support Intel Cherrytrail platform and old Mid platform.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.


config SERIAL_HSU_CONSOLE
	bool "Console on Intel HSU serial port"
	depends on SERIAL_HSU=y
	select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
	  to that serial port.
